    "The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.<img align=\"right\" src=\"Grid.png\" HEIGHT=\"400\" WIDTH=\"266\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"game\" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional array of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- alive: cell has value = 1\n",
    "- dead: cell has value = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. See Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules of the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step in time (also called \"tick\"), the following transitions occur to all cells simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction."
